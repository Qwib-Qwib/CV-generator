/* The button-wrapper class is used around update buttons to tightly fit them and take their size so that the button
inside them can be offset relative to "their own size". I use it a little later to offset the button 100% to the right,
100% being the button's own width, so that they stick to the outside of the resume and don't bother the user while
they're editing values. */
